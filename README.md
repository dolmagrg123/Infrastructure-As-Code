# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows developers to codify infrastructure in a way that makes provisioning automated, faster, and repeatable. It’s a key component of Agile and DevOps practices such as version control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.

### Infrastructure as code can help with the following:

* Improve speed: Automation is faster than manually navigating an interface when you need to deploy and/or connect resources.
* Improve reliability: If your infrastructure is large, it becomes easy to misconfigure a resource or provision services in the wrong order. With IaC, the resources are always provisioned and configured exactly as declared.
* Prevent configuration drift: Configuration drift occurs when the configuration that provisioned your environment no longer matches the actual environment. (See ‘Immutable infrastructure’ below.)
* Support experimentation, testing, and optimization: Because Infrastructure as Code makes provisioning new infrastructure so much faster and easier, you can make and test experimental changes without investing lots of time and resources; and if you like the results, you can quickly scale up the new infrastructure for production.
